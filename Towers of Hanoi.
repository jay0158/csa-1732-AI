% move(N, Source, Destination, Auxiliary)
% This predicate will print the steps required to move N disks from Source to Destination using Auxiliary as an intermediate.

move(1, Source, Destination, _) :-
    write('Move disk from '), write(Source), write(' to '), write(Destination), nl.
move(N, Source, Destination, Auxiliary) :-
    N > 1,
    M is N - 1,
    move(M, Source, Auxiliary, Destination),
    move(1, Source, Destination, _),
    move(M, Auxiliary, Destination, Source).

% solve_hanoi(N)
% This predicate initiates the process to solve the Towers of Hanoi with N disks.

solve_hanoi(N) :-
    move(N, left, right, center).

% Example query to solve for 3 disks:
% ?- solve_hanoi(3).
